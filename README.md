# Exercise 4.24 Guest list from a file

Implement a program that checks whether names entered by the user are on the guest list. The input should stop when a user enters an empty string. Some example output is below.

```plaintext
Name of the file:
**guestlist.txt**

Enter names, an empty line quits.
**Chuck Norris**
The name is not on the list.
**Jack Baluer**
The name is not on the list.
**Jack Bauer**
The name is on the list.
**Jack Bower**
The name is on the list.

Thank you!
```

**NB!** The exercise template comes with two files, `names.txt` and `other-names.txt`, which have the following contents. Do not change the contents of the files!

####names.txt:
```plaintext
ada
arto
leena
test
```

####other-names.txt:
```plaintext
leo
jarmo
alicia
```
